                     Originally an RCOS project, MoveMaster was created with the vision
                     of combining physics simulation and machine learning to determine
                     the most optimal move set for winning various online and tabletop
                     games. By leveraging advanced computational techniques, MoveMaster
                     strives to provide users with strategic recommendations tailored
                     to the selected game.
