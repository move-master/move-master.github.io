                     Originally an RCOS project, MoveMaster was created with the vision
                     of combining physics simulation and machine learning to determine
                     the most optimal move set for winning various online and tabletop
                     games. By leveraging advanced computational techniques, MoveMaster
                     strives to provide users with strategic recommendations tailored
                     to the selected game.

                       made of 54 wooden blocks, and stacking these pieces on top. The
                       objective of the game is to avoid knocking over the tower.
                       Although this seems like a relatively simple objective, in
                       practice, this proves to be easier said than done.

                       <br />
                       MoveMaster allows users to define the current state of a Jenga
                       game (i.e., the displacement of blocks). Based on the current
                       configuration of the tower, MoveMaster suggests the best
                       possible move to maximize a player&#039;s chances of success.
                       <br />
                       As it currently stands, Jenga is the only tabletop game we have
                       been developing MoveMaster for. However, we are open to
                       exploring other tabletop games in the future.

                       We first started working on MoveMaster in the summer of 2024.
                       Over the course of U24, we achieved the following:

                         Developed a basic conjecture about when blocks are safe vs.

                       Because the physical dynamics behind Jenga are extremely tedious
                       to calculate by hand, and it is impossible to simulate all
                       possible tower configurations to determine the outcome of every
                       game state, we decided to come up with a generalized conjecture
                       about when blocks are safe vs. unsafe to remove. Although this
                       required us to greatly simplify the problem at hand (i.e., we
                       ignored stochastic factors like human error, friction between
                       blocks, and non-uniformity among pieces), this conjecture
                       enabled us to begin developing a working model that we would
                       eventually expand to include these factors.

                       To aid in our discourse surrounding the development of our Unity
                       game-state simulator, we created a very primitive game-state
                       visualizer using Scratch. The visualizer accepts a 54-bit binary
                       sequence of 0s and 1s, and visualizes this sequence as a Jenga
                       tower, where 0s are empty spaces and 1s are blocks.

                       To serve as a basic framework/prototype for our eventual
                       machine-learning program, we created a Jenga game-state
                       simulator that makes use of Unity&#039;s built-in physics
                       engine. This simulator allows a user to remove blocks from the
                       tower, watch the outcome of their configuration in real time (by
                       enabling physics), and save/load various configurations of said
                       tower. Additionally, this simulator acts a slightly more
                       sophisticated version of our initial Scratch game-state
