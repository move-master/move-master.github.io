                     Originally an RCOS project, MoveMaster was created with the vision
                     of combining physics simulation and machine learning to determine
                     the most optimal move set for winning various online and tabletop
                     games. By leveraging advanced computational techniques, MoveMaster
                     strives to provide users with strategic recommendations tailored

                       made of 54 wooden blocks, and stacking these pieces on top. The
                       objective of the game is to avoid knocking over the tower.
                       Although this seems like a relatively simple objective, in
                       practice, this proves to be easier said than done.

                       <br />
                       MoveMaster allows users to define the current state of a Jenga
                       game (i.e., the displacement of blocks). Based on the current
                       configuration of the tower, MoveMaster suggests the best
                       possible move to maximize a player&#039;s chances of success.
                       <br />
                       As it currently stands, Jenga is the only tabletop game we have
                       been developing MoveMaster for. However, we are open to
                       exploring other tabletop games in the future.

                       We first started working on MoveMaster in the summer of 2024.
                       Over the course of U24, we achieved the following:

                         Developed a basic conjecture about when blocks are safe vs.

                       Because the physical dynamics behind Jenga are extremely tedious
                       to calculate by hand, and it is impossible to simulate all
                       possible tower configurations to determine the outcome of every
                       game state, we decided to come up with a generalized conjecture
                       about when blocks are safe vs. unsafe to remove. Although this
                       required us to greatly simplify the problem at hand (i.e., we
                       ignored stochastic factors like human error, friction between
                       blocks, and non-uniformity among pieces), this conjecture
                       enabled us to begin developing a working model that we would
                       eventually expand to include these factors.

                       To aid in our discourse surrounding the development of our Unity
                       game-state simulator, we created a very primitive game-state
                       visualizer using Scratch. The visualizer accepts a 54-bit binary
                       sequence of 0s and 1s, and visualizes this sequence as a Jenga
                       tower, where 0s are empty spaces and 1s are blocks.

                       To serve as a basic framework/prototype for our eventual

                       simulator that makes use of Unity&#039;s built-in physics
                       engine. This simulator allows a user to remove blocks from the
                       tower, watch the outcome of their configuration in real time (by
                       enabling physics), and save/load various configurations of said
                       tower. Additionally, this simulator acts a slightly more

                      In a classic game of Jenga, there are 54 wooden blocks. Assuming we can have less than 54 blocks in play at any point in the game (i.e., assuming we break the official rules of Jenga), this means that there are 2<sup>54</sup> = 18,014,398,509,000,000 (roughly 18 quadrillion) unique configurations of jenga blocks achievable by simply removing pieces from the original tower. In order to differentiate these game states from one another, let’s represent a game configuration as a 54-bit long sequence of binary:<br/>

                      <div class="binary">111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111</div>

                      <span class="overview-text-2-span5">
                        In our model, the left-most bits represent the blocks at the very bottom of the tower, and the right-most bits represent the blocks at the very top of the tower. Additionally, “1” bits indicate the presence of a block in that position, while “0” bits indicate the absence of a block. Furthermore, every tribit represents a layer in the Jenga tower, with the bits progressing from furthest from the camera → closest to the camera when being read from left → right. 
                        Since this manner of representing the configuration of a Jenga game is not particularly intuitive, we provide a labeled diagram to the right:

                    Visualizing this sequence, we have the following game configuration:<br/>

                    <img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="jenga-tower-cropped" src="images/mtgm-tower-1.png" />

                    This would be considered a “<b>success state</b>” because this tower is structurally sound and would not collapse.<br/>
                    Let’s consider another sequence:<br/>

                    <div class="binary">010 010 010 010 010 010 010 010 010 010 010 010 010 010 010 010 010 010</div>

                    If we were to visualize the above sequence:<br/>

                    <img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="jenga-tower-cropped" src="images/mtgm-tower-2.png" />

                    Similar to the previous configuration, this would also be considered a “success state” because this tower is structurally sound and would not collapse.<br/>
                    On the other hand, if we were to visualize a sequence like:<br/>

                    <div class="binary">111 111 111 000 000 000 111 111 111 000 000 000 111 111 111 000 000 000</div>

                    This would result in the following game configuration:<br/>

                    <img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="jenga-tower-cropped" src="images/mtgm-tower-3.png" />

                    This would immediately be ruled out as a “<b>fail state</b>” because the tower is (clearly) unstable and would collapse.<br/>
                    Similarly, if we were to visualize a sequence like:<br/>

                    <div class="binary">001 001 100 100 001 001 100 100 001 001 100 100 001 001 100 100 001 001</div>

                    This would result in the following game configuration:<br/>

                    <img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="jenga-tower-cropped" src="images/mtgm-tower-4.png" />

                    Again, this would be considered a “fail state” because the tower is highly unstable and would collapse.<br/>

                    Although we could simply use the physics engine to determine which states are success and fail states (i.e., whether or not the tower falls over), if we assume that running a single simulation takes 0.1 seconds, this means that simulating all 2<sup>54</sup> possible configurations would take approximately 57,123,283 years (this is unreasonably long!). Thus, we must rely on analysis techniques to eliminate as many fail states as we can.<br/><br/>
                    <span class="overview-text-span3">
                      Eliminating “Fail States” Through Analysis
                      <br />
                    </span>
                    As demonstrated earlier, not all 2<sup>54</sup> of these configurations are physically possible, as some of these combinations would result in floating pieces, or pieces whose center of mass is not supported, immediately constituting a fail state. In order to determine what fraction of these configurations result in fail states, let us reconsider 2 of the above examples:

                    <img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" class="jenga-tower-wide" src="images/mtgm-tower-5.png" />

                    On the <b>left</b> is <span class="binary">111 111 111 000 000 000 111 111 111 000 000 000 111 111 111 000 000 000</span>.<br/>
                    On the <b>right</b> is <span class="binary">001 001 100 100 001 001 100 100 001 001 100 100 001 001 100 100 001 001</span>.<br/>

                    A similarity that exists between these two fail configurations is the presence of <b>two or more consecutive zeros within a single tribit</b>. Let’s visualize some more sequences to determine if this is a consistent pattern:<br/>
